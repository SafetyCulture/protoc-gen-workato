# protoc-gen-workato

This is a [Workato Connector](https://docs.workato.com/developing-connectors/sdk.html) generator for Google Protocol Buffers compiler `protoc`. The plugin generates a Connector file based on your publicly tagged methods.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/SafetyCulture/protoc-gen-workato@latest
```

## Usage

The plugin is invoked by passing the --workato_out, and --workato_opt options to the protoc compiler. The option has the following format:

```bash
--doc_opt=workato/config.yaml
```

Generation of the actions in workato relies on the usage of [`google.api.http`](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto#L46) and [`grpc.gateway.protoc_gen_openapiv2.options`](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/blob/master/protoc-gen-openapiv2/options/annotations.proto) annotations.

A complete example can be found in `proto/`.

## Development

This repo uses [buf](https://buf.build) to build Protocol Buffers.
```bash
brew tap bufbuild/buf
brew install buf
```
To generate the image for fixtures run `buf build -o fixtures/image.bin`.
To generate the annotations Go package run `buf generate`.
Example `buf generate s12/protobuf/workato/annotations.proto`.

## Testing
```bash
go test -v -run TestGenerateWorkatoConnector
```

After you are happy with the results, to update the snapshot run this command:
```bash
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true go test -v -run TestGenerateWorkatoConnector
```

To test locally, you can use this command in `cmd/protoc-gen-workato` folder
```bash
go install ./...
```
Will install in your `go/bin` folder a binary with the name `protoc-gen-workato`
After this, go to the APISchema repository and run:
```bash
buf generate --template buf.gen.workato.yaml -o "_generated/workato"
```
This will enable you to manually check the generated file and compare to the one generated by the old generator cmd:
```bash
make workato
```


## Field Options

### Control Type Override

You can override the default control type for fields using the `control_type` option:

```proto
message MyRequest {
  // This repeated enum field will be rendered as a string input instead of multiselect
  repeated MyEnum status_list = 1 [(s12.protobuf.workato.field) = { control_type: "string" }];
}
```

This is particularly useful when you want to:
- Allow users to input comma-separated values instead of using a multiselect dropdown
- Provide more flexibility in how enum values are entered
- Override the default UI behavior for specific fields

**Examples:**
- `control_type: "string"` - renders as a text input
- `control_type: "text"` - renders as a text input  
- `control_type: "multiselect"` - renders as a multiselect dropdown (default for repeated enums)
- `control_type: "select"` - renders as a single select dropdown
